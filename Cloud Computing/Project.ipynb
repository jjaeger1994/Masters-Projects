Like buying shares of a company, these \"product tokens\" also come with voting rights to allow a product\\'s most active supporters real influence in its development prior to launch. Ultimately, after the product is released to the public, token owners are paid out when sales are made at the product\\'s final retail price (Ex. if you own 5 product tokens, you are paid out for 5 sales).

Transitioning has always been at the forefront of my mind all my life, and I’m 27 now. I’ve done it once and detransitioned, mainly because of the high pressure to be passable and just life in general being harder/scarier, and also my sex life.  But, I still can’t seem to shake it off. No matter how many times I try to rationalize it in my head. It feels like deep it’s something I always want to do.  I was even at a party yesterday night and remember interacting with so many people and even having a great time, but deep down wishing I was perceived basically as a woman. I don’t know why, but I think it’s a need to be seen as beautiful, and femininity/feminine beauty in a womanly form is the highest expression of that in my opinion.  I think I have masculinity and femininity in me, and I know the rigid stereotypes or rules of expression are bullshit (girls can only wear girls clothes and boys can only wear boys clothes, etc). I know I will never be a real woman, I’ve accepted that I am male and actually like that in some ways (happy I have a penis lol).  I also find myself trying to be comfortable with my masculine form but sort of feminizing it in some weird ways and I’m not sure if I’m totally satisfied to be honest. Like am I just bullshitting myself and want to transition anyways… you know what I mean?  I think the thing I can’t get over is just the detrimental effects of HRT on my genitals, sex life and health overtime. And the money for surgeries. And also maybe the jealousy of other members of my natal sex getting to be so free and not worry about shit like this.  Idk. I’m just rambling. It’s hard to figure this shit out.

I love the discussions that are going on in this subreddit, and I recently did a bit of a study on the (American) constitutional system, and decided to try my hand at revamping it while keeping the basic premises.  The document is linked here , with perhaps a more permanent link at ResearchGate here .  I know it\\'s long, but the important parts for this group that could use some feedback or discussion are: A) The appendix, which sketches out how members of the House of Representatives could be chosen by a local assembly, elected through Proportional Representation (perhaps party list). The benefit here as I see it is that a multi-party assembly would require some representatives to be elected by coalition, and there\\'s an incentive to vote for additional parties at times if you want to push one of the main parties in a certain direction. - It assumes we want to keep single member districts (though I\\'m open to reviewing that) - It allows the assembly to keep their rep in check, and maybe remove them with a supermajority and do a fast replacement (I\\'m thinking about this situation with Santos this week!) - If these local assemblies are kept in direct proportion to the population, then they can be used for national referendums which are also proportionate and gerrymander-resistant. - One concern I have is whether this is actually creating an \"indirect election\" for house of reps, which is not my intent - and if so, would this lead to any specific objections or issues?  B) In section 5, this proposal includes a new body called the executive council to work alongside the president. It has been proposed several times in our history. - The idea here is that the president will be elected using apportionment from the house of representations, and the executive council would use the senate (statewise) scheme. This makes the proposal apportionment neutral - as the current electoral college is a combination of both.. (I\\'m not against arguments about the way the constitution handles apportionment, but I wanted to take that off the table for a bit) - Specifically, in section 5.2, you can see how a fully Condorcet method, while being difficult to implement in a vote of millions of people, is actually quite possible in an electoral college situation. - I believe that candidate lists from the states counted in this way would lead to a higher likelihood of independent candidates, and campaigns that would reach all 50 states. This is because a candidate would want even a solid red or blue state to rank them higher - even if they are with the other party!  Hope you enjoy! You can read the full paper or just read the summary above - and I look forward to having some discussions on here to improve this proposal and others, and also comparisons with other governments.  /u/maxsklar r/EndFPTP [link] [comments]', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/EndFPTP/comments/18a501k/my_sketched_proposals_to_end_fptp_in_the_house/', 0.0)\n",

I have a part-time job in retail and my boss has asked me to help with designing a website for his side-gig.  It is worth noting that web development is not my primary area of career interest at this stage.  The points below are the factors I know and have considered.   He has registered an account with GoDaddy, which I cannot access, and paid for the domain (business name) through GoDaddy.  Existing online presence on Facebook and Instagram, transactions are currently handled via DMs, as well as in-person promotions (probably main form of business)  He wants to be able to process payments via Stripe on his websites for services (possibly goods as well), his scope of services are expanding over time, other than that it will be a typical e-commerce website with users, products, orders stored in a database, handled via forms.  I think the website will need to have separate desktop and mobile UIs.  In your opinion, am I likely to have the experience/resources/manpower to commit to helping on this project?  How could web server, database server and ongoing maintenance/fixes/updates and their associated costs be handled? Who would provide the server space?  How long will it likely take?  How would I go about implementing security features and dealing with any costs (digital certificates or static IPs for example) ?    Any advice or pointers are very much appreciated. And if anyone thinks it's a bad idea for me to do this, please say why in as much detail as possible so I can feed-back to him.  I think my biggest reservations are about the costs and managements of the infrastructure and post-release maintenance in web design, more than learning how to code things.  If I decline the request for help, I don't want to decline it unhelpfully.

I’ve never had to return something before. I’ve had a look through the subreddit and from what I can see, if you’ve purchased something with a ‘free return’ badge, the return should be free.  As you can see from the screenshot, Ali is saying that I have to pay in the first instance. Seems easy for Ali/seller to say item arrived damaged, or not at all, and then I’d be out of pocket.  Is this normal?  Reason for return: no longer needed. Return address looks to be U.K. warehouse.

Two things:  FIRST:   Now that the video is out, we've seen people sending us youtuber recommendations, but it's getting buried in all of the other reactions on the internet. SO, I wanted to make a space for people to recommend youtubers who scratch that queer media essay/pop culture commentary itch and bring a kind of commentary that isn't visible enough on the platform.  Once we have the time to watch and vet the videos, I'll be adding them to the recommendation playlist and find other ways to highlight them.  I worked very hard on that playlist to have a REALLY solid list of creators I know would grab people's attention and it is WILD to see more and more creators with tragically small followings come out of the woodwork. I'm really pleased with it all.  SECOND: I ALSO wanted to make a space for people to share additional plagiarism discoveries about any of the youtubers we featured, so we can compile a more complete list of people who have been plagiarized.  Once we have this list complete (or at least when the discoveries start to plateau), we'll distribute our ad revenue for this video to people on the list (prioritizing people who were never paid for their work at all). It... may also be used to make more second channel content. 👀  People have also been requesting a way to donate money to the plagiarized writers, so we are working on that now! (We may even do a fundraising stream!)

Sometimes changing the speed helps, but sometimes it starts in one speed, but others I turn it on and then change the speed and it just goes (others it's just dead and nothing does anything).  \\u200b  I don't think that there is a capacitor, but i can't tell. The motor is a 120v, 1 phase, 1.3A, 60hz at 300-2000 CS/M (nothing about RPM, but I think it would be 300-2000 RPM too).  There is a speed knob, and wires go to a box at the rear that looks like it may be a controller of some sort, or an AC to DC converter, and then the motor runs an armature that moves the saw arm and blade. I don't know what the issue is, but the motor doesn't start unless the speed control is in a certain spot, or the arm is manually moved (or the speed control is moved after being switched on, sometimes it starts).  /u/Academic_Nectarine94 r/Tools [link] [comments]\", 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Tools/comments/18a50g9/scroll_saw_motor_dead/', -0.4000000059604645)\n",

The listening space is a 25' x 20' area around my computer desk.  Challenge : The subwoofer will require a cable run of over 25' from the receiver. My receiver only has an RCA output for the subwoofer, and I'm concerned about potential noise over this long unbalanced run. The subwoofer does have both RCA and XLR inputs.  Specific Question : Is the ART CLEANBox Pro – Dual Channel Level Converter the best solution for converting the unbalanced RCA output to a balanced XLR input? Or are there better alternatives?  Request for Advice : I'm looking for recommendations on how to best handle this conversion. I saw some RCA to XLR cables, but I'm not sure if they provide a true balanced connection. What are your thoughts or experiences with long cable runs and noise reduction? Also, any other product recommendations or general advice are welcome.

I have been searching through reddit, but I have a learning disability and am feeling overwhelmed with all the options. I am writing this both to ask for your recomendations, as well as help myself understand the process.  My friend and I like to sing karaoke in our homes by following along with YouTube lyric videos. We would likely still do this even if we had those machines that project the lyrics as we like both indie and mainstraem music. I have looked at the app Karafun; it seems affordable, so I might get my friend a gift card for that as well.  We currently do not have any equipment. Although we are not singers by any means, we have both started taking the hobby more seriously (as in actually trying to improve while still having fun).  A point of consideration for me is that I would like to begin buying the parts of a decent at-home karoake system one at a time. However, would this even be feasible if I want my gift to be usable ASAP? From my limited understanding, we would need a microphone. But in using a microphone, we would then need a mixer and new speakers since most at home-speakers are not meant for live vocals. To make my gift usable ASAP, what would you recommend I buy first?

Three years ago for the first time of my life, while i was working desk job I experienced an incident where my heart really painfully squeezed (with stabbing pain) (it felt like a strong stabbing pain, like a stab with a knife). After that, every heartbeat came with little stabbing pain, and I also felt a slight numbness and pain in my left arm. Unfortunately, at that time, I didn\\'t go to the doctor and ignored it, going to sleep instead. The pain subsided after sleep, but since then, approximately every 2 to 3 weeks, I\\'ve been experiencing heart pain (its split second, stabbing pain). Sometimes it\\'s also painless weird feeling in cheest (like something mooving), and other times, it\\'s a very painful, momentary stabbing sensation always in the same place (the left side of the chest above the nipple near the sternum, as if in the upper left part of the heart). I recently after 3 years decited to consult cardiologist who stated that the EKG and echocardiogram show no abnormalities, and I shouldn\\'t be worried. However, I\\'ve noticed that the pains are becoming more frequent and intense. Because of this, I would like to undergo more detailed examinations, such as a heart tomography or something that would exclude possible heart problems. But the cardiologist was unwilling to send me to it because i am very young and dont have history of family heart problems. Is it wrong on my part that I want to understand the cause of these pains that concern me? Should i go to doctor with second opinion. I stopped exercising, cuz pain comes more often when i am active and also I get tired much faster, than before .

I was looking through the popular posts recently, and I saw a post about a video made by a teacher on the US education system, saying that students in middle school can't read, write, do math, etc. at a grade level and that an older generation of elementary school students in the reading disability program were performing at a much higher level than these students. Many of the comments on that post agreed with the video, saying that high school students also struggled with these issues.  On the other hand, I also see a lot of content on A2C or other college subs, which shows a completely different perspective with kids getting 4.0+ GPA, doing 10+ clubs, IOI, USAMO, whatever. Most of the students in these subs are performing at a much higher level than the video describes.  As a high school student, I see much more of the second kind of behavior at my school, where in most of my classes everyone generally gets A's, it is considered normal to take 3-6 APs in a given year, etc. I myself also do lots of ecs, do academic competitions, etc. to be competitive for college applications.  Going back to all of this, my question is: Why is there such a massive gap between what my notions of an average student are, and what some teachers say average students are? Additionally, what changes should be made to reconcile these two views of the school system?  Before anyone says it's a school system difference, I attend a public school in Indiana nowhere near Carmel/Indie, so I don't think it's because I go to an overfunded school/magnet/feeder.  /u/cultfollower_ r/education [link] [comments]\", 'https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/18a50sk/2_different_views_of_us_education_system/', -0.20000000298023224)\n",

Despite this, war, poverty, and colonial exploitation of Eritrea's people, not its resources, have repeatedly set back Eritrea. Eritrea is a net importer of nearly all economic sectors, aside from agricultural products, further increasing its demand on Europe, forcing it once again under the heel of European institutions, now under neo-colonialism. However, exploiting Eritrea's resources raises several questions: how will this be done? And who will fund it?  The Man Who Spoke Russian  Once more, Soviet assistance has proven vital in Eritrea. One by one, planes bearing the designs of Aeroflot landed at Asmara International Airport. Hundreds of Soviet technical personnel—geologists, surveyors, engineers, estimators, and many more—had begun to stream into the country, all due to the graciousness of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. President Hamid's dream, and that of every Eritrean, now became clearer than ever, and it is the hand of the Soviet Union that now lifts the country out of its impoverished state.  Establishment of the Eritrean Geological Survey  The Soviets had given the Eritrea a blank checkbook and President Hamid was eager to use it to the limits of the project. Reliance on foreign assistance is a contributor in Eritrea's current situation, necessitating the development of government organizations to continue the work that Soviet assistance will provide. Thus, the Eritrean Geological Survey is established. Responsible for studying the landscape of Eritrea, its natural resources, and the natural hazards that threaten it. The agency is also responsible for the maritime surveying of Eritrea's portion of the Red Sea.  Eritrea's First Survey  Eritrea is at the southern end of the Red Sea, one of the few unexplored places left in the world. As such, its potential is limitless. Gold, Copper, and Zinc have all been found in sizable quantities in the country despite being limited to artisanal mining. In terms of hydrocarbons, while lacking the necessary pre-rift, syn-rift, and post-rift sedimentary units, the Eritrean Red Sea Basin does. Exploration has been going on piecemeal since 1921, but only 11 wells have ever been drilled, all yielding minimal deposits. However, the petroleum industry has skyrocketed over the past 20 years, and so have its relevant technologies.  Given its relatively shallow depths, petroleum and natural gas exploration will concentrate around the southeastern areas of the Dahlak Archipelago to avoid disturbing pearl fishermen closer to the coast. The islands are ideal, lacking a sizable population area, reducing the need for relocation and providing a cheap alternative to offshore drilling. With assistance from Soviet technicians, the Geological Survey will conduct a detailed geological and geophysical survey to identify potential petroleum reservoirs; teams will conduct seismic reflection, gravity, and magnetic surveys (thanks to the Soviets) will be used to map subsurface structures and determine the optimal locations for exploratory wells.  Upon completing this, exploratory drilling in high-potential areas identified through the geological survey will begin. Implementing a phased drilling approach, teams will start at stratigraphic wells to gather information on rock formations, followed by exploratory wells to assess hydrocarbon presence, after which reservoir analysis will be done to evaluate the size, depth, and quality of discovered hydrocarbon reservoirs. Well-testing will determine reservoir pressure, fluid composition, and production rates.  The Eritrean government has shown considerable interest in petroleum exploration, prompting ongoing attempts to survey the country's land. Artisanal mining, with a history spanning thousands of years in Eritrea, has long revealed the presence of valuable resources such as gold, zinc, copper, oil, potash, limestone, gypsum, and iron ore. While the knowledge of these resources has been established, the optimal locations for exploitation remain to be identified. With Soviet assistance, comprehensive surveys will be conducted on potential quarries, mines, and mineral fields to pinpoint strategic areas for future mineral exploitation.  /u/Tropic_Bacon r/ColdWarPowers [link] [comments]\", 'https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/18a50vq/econ_the_eritrean_geological_survey/', 0.0)\n",

It begins by discussing the semantics around Colonialism, and what that can mean in the context of a Post-Colonial state (Like India, for example) trying to do the same. The next few sections are devoted to discussing India's state-building projects in Kashmir, as well as how they factored into further consolidating Indian power in the region, from 1947 onwards, focusing mainly on the role played by Bakshi Ghulam Muhammad and his government. The book then concludes with a brief resummary of its thesis, now fully complimented by the topics discussed in the aforementioned sections, as well as a devastating critique of Indian Secularism as we know it.  My great love for this book comes from the fact that it starts from the very beginning, even before partition. It starts its discussion of India's crimes in the region by discussing the Jammu Massacres (Very topical given how India refuses to acknowledge it), as well as breaking down and rebutting India's claims of ownership in the region. Alongside this, it goes beyond when discussing the various mechanisms employed by the Indian state to entrench itself in Kashmir, to incorporate elements that people usually overlook, such as that of film/photography, tourism, appeals to the greater Islamic world at the time, and the funding of academics supportive of the regime's viewpoints. A wonderful link is made between the attitudes of the Indian government (As well as the Kashmiri government by extension) and that of the British a century before them towards Kashmir and its inhabitants. Lastly, I was very much captivated by the book's choice of discussing the role of Bakshi Ghulam Muhammad over someone more noticeable (Like the Abdullahs). Before reading this book, I had only really thought of him as another government stooge filling in a gap between Sheikh Abdullah's release, however now, I can confidently say that quite a few of Kashmir's modern problems can probably be traced back almost solely to this man and his administration. It gave me a greater hatred for someone I had originally thought to be a simple stooge.  Anyhow, this book is packed with wonderful information, and I'd recommend anyone interested give it a read.

I commented asking what they possibly had in common with 15 and 16 year olds that they would need to speak privately. They asked if I was stalking them, and I reminded them that their interactions with minors was public. They deleted the comments on the minors' posts, and then deleted their account.

I am still grieving over this big time. My depression is constant. I cannot feel joy. I'm confused, dizzy, numb hands and feet, foggy, unable to work, and in constant 24/7 discomfort.

I\\'ll share some things that personally worked well for me after having a flight that had to be my best, with the lowest amount of panic/anxiety:   I booked a very early morning flight to get it over with. I basically woke up early, went to the airport and boarded.  I planned \"treats\" for both at the airport and when I would land: my favourite drinks and snacks and then a delicious meal when I landed.  I downloaded different options that were comforting to me: movies, music, and even a few meditations.  Noise cancelling headphones: these made a huge difference in not having to really \"hear\" that youre on a plane  this one might be just me, but I like watching the \"map\" so I could count down how much was left and give myself a pep talk \"great job, you already did one of the hard parts - takeoff - and now you only have two hours to go\"  I purchased wifi so I could message my mom if I got too scared. Yes, I\\'m 40 years old and still want to talk to my mom when I\\'m scared 😂 I also tried to think of people I admire who fly all the time and how much they love it.

The odd thing is I also regularly wear shirts from other schools like UGA and Emory and never once have comments on those. For some reason it’s Harvard only where I get these comments.

I got my first printer a few days ago, an Anycubic Kobra 2 Neo. So far it prints fairly good for the price with no major issues except for this crazy stringing/branching.  I\\'m printing with SUNLU High-Speed PLA with the stock profile for PrusaSlicer 0.2mm layer height and 150mm/s print speed. I\\'ve tweaked the temps a bit since SUNLU recommend 180-190 C for this filament so I\\'m using 180C nozzle and 60C bed. The room where the printer is located is at 15 C and arount 50-60% humidity, I know is not optimal and I have a food dehydrator on the way to dehumidify my filament.I\\'ve already calibrated x-y-z steps and e-step. I\\'ve done some quick temp tower and things seems good around 180C. 175 looks fine but seem a bit more fragile when trying to breaking it.This is the result of a retraction test with stock settings: 2mm retraction at 80mm/s, z-hop 0.3mm, travel speed 120mm/s  https://preview.redd.it/natbtgkon54c1.jpg?width=1540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea859f98a60ede8e2655d065e7d8fac15d2282e1  I\\'ve tried different combination of retraction lenght (1.6mm to 2.8mm, retraction speed from 20 to 80, deretraction speed, travel speed but i can\\'t get rid of the stringing. Only once it reduced in a temp tower at 170C but it was way to fragile so I think that it is too cold temperature.  This is the best result I had so far with 2.5 mm retraction at 80mm/s, 30 deretraction speed, 150 travel speed and 177 C  https://preview.redd.it/aip8znbpn54c1.jpg?width=1187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3d1868fdab26f184a4ae49d435d8620b10075cb  I tried cleaning the nozzle by removing the filament and sticking the needle they give you with the printer, with the nozzle at 215 C, and it seems fine. I also tried tightening the extruder screw by three quarter of a turn thinking it may be skipping a bit but it didn\\'t make any noticeable difference.  If I print the 30min benchy they give you in the microsd card it prints mostly fine with some minor string here and there. Instead printing a hexagonal penholder it was a spiderweb mess with branching.  The only other strange thing I\\'ve notices is that when I load the filament and it extrudes it sometimes some fumes come out the nozzle... it may be some humidity in the filament (it\\'s open from 5 days) but other the stringing the prints looks ok.  So far the only \"failed\" print I\\'ve had is a temp tower when it tried to print the last \"step\" at 165 C and it wasn\\'t extruding anymore so I immidiately stopped it and then extruded some filament to make sure it wasn\\'t clogged.

However post ROTK, the Oscars shifted away from high grossing films. A lot of it is mainly due to how most of the highest grossing films were franchise films that didn't deserve to be called the best film of the year.  Oppenheimer though is the rare film that has a massive box office behind it, critical support that something like Joker, Bohemian Rhapsody etc lacked and doesn't belong to a franchise.

I\\'ve heard about the loud disc drive noises, particularly during game installations, which sound like someone uttering a prolonged \"ahhhhhhhh.\" While I\\'ve employed the unscrew method to mitigate the noise, I\\'m still a bit apprehensive due to my overthinking tendencies.  Initially, game installations were quite swift, and I don\\'t recall seeing the disc icon in the top-middle portion of the screen. However, now that it appears, the installation process has slowed down.  Additionally, I\\'ve noticed a faint beep when powering off my PS5.  Are these occurrences normal, or should I be concerned?

Yes, it could. I'm a firm believer of communication, so if I want a relationship with you, I'll tell you. If you prefer to keep it casual then let me know beforehand.

It has been impossible to contact the customer service for some time, many people have been stranded in Munich.  I am one of those people. I was supposed to go to Hamburg to visit someone for the weekend. Since there is no way in or out of Munich (trains are also stopped), I was just trying to enjoy the weekend here while waiting for my flight back on Monday evening.  However, my flight back was from Hamburg to Munich, then connecting to my city. This of course would mean they would expect me to board in Hamburg, otherwise my ticket wouldn\\'t be valid in Munich. I thus decide to try calling the customer service to ask to board in Munich only.  At the 24th call of the day (having had only 1 answer previously telling me they cannot do anything on the phone and I have to go to the airport, which was impossible to reach except with a 200€ Uber ride!), I manage to get someone on the line and I explain my issue.  Me: \"...so you see, I am happy to just cancel the Hamburg to Munich leg and keep the ticket from Munich to my city only!\"  Agent: \"Ok, let\\'s check this, can I put you briefly on hold?\"  I agree, I am put on hold for another 5 minutes, then the agent comes back on the line.  Agent: \"Ok, great, since this is a change on your flight, you would need you pay for this.\"  Me, not sure if I heard correctly: \"Sorry, did you just say I would need to pay for it?!\"  Agent: \"Yes, we cannot make a change on flight departure airport without a fee.\"  Me, flabbergasted: \"Oh, ok then, since that\\'s the case, I will keep my original flight instead! However, I haven\\'t reached my destination yet... So instead you can get me on a rebooked flight to Hamburg today so I can take the flight back from Hamburg tomorrow!\"  Agent is silent on the line for a few seconds.  Me: \"There are no flights to Hamburg, right?\"  Agent: \"...right.\"  Me: \"Ah! Exactly. So you see the issue.\"  Another brief silence from the agent. Then I\\'m asked to be put on hold again. When they come back, a note has been added to my request that the ticket was issued without payment, and I am supposed to leave directly from Munich tomorrow :)  (Please send your good vibes for the flight to actually be scheduled tomorrow!)  /u/ilalla r/MaliciousCompliance [link] [comments]', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/18a51z0/flights_disruptions_compliance/', -0.30000001192092896)\n",

I was bringing in about 1600 a month then, and it worked out to be in that range and I could afford everything plus lots of extra. Flash forward now, and the same 2 bedroom was listed for 2750. That’s 2000 more a month. now I make about 3000 net a month as a single divorcee, double what I was making then approximately. so try to find a 1 bedroom apartment(not a closet or hallway curtain off) and they are going for 1800 in the most bed bug crack building. So to afford to live in the worst the city has to offer, and keep on track with that percentage that allows you to live comfortably within your means, mean you have to bring in a net of 9000 a month to “do economics right” Who is renting these? Are they actually paying it or are these buildings setting the rent so high that people arnt paying and everything is being defaulted on? I’m struggling now, with the highest paid job and most hours I’ve ever got. To live on your own if you make twice minimum wage, it’s now 75 percent of your monthly wage. Don’t even get me started on what I call “land dukes” these are the people who sign the lease of that 1800 1 bedroom, then rent out the living room, and hallway with a Curtain for 1000 each and not only walk away with free rent, but a profit  TLDR  Explain economics to me again, cause I blinked and have no idea what to do anymore  /u/FormerMonitor3968 r/halifax [link] [comments]', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/18a51yb/so_what_percentage_of_your_monthly_income_should/', -0.4000000059604645)\n",

The two kittens for which I applied are from the same litter and were listed as a pair for adoption.  Due to the large number of applicants for the litter, they are now asking if it is acceptable to separate them instead of choosing a single applicant. Now, I will get one kitten from the original pair that I applied for and will have the opportunity to adopt another kitten from a different litter. The reason for separation is, they want every person to have the opportunity to adopt a kitten from that particular litter.  I feel a little taken aback due to the fact that these kittens are close with each other and am wondering how bad this would be for them since they are relatives.

There were the family members - Pops; Jessa; Joy and her husband, Austin; Justin and his wife, Claire; as well as Josh\\'s wife, Anna. They all looked like they were attending a funeral. They were pale. Exhausted. Beaten.   Jill suggests Pest\\'s glib demeanor was a \"nervous\" reaction. Some kind of \"gallows humor\" perhaps? People suggested a similar explanation for Justin\\'s infamous \"thumbs up\" pose.  But if Pest can\\'t act seriously during the most dire moments of his life, even when he is facing imminent incarceration for his crimes, can he ever treat anything seriously?  Think he acts the same way when Anna and his kids visit him in prison? Keeping the same shit-eating grin and cracking godawful jokes? I wonder if he keeps the same good humor when his lawyers deliver news about his repeated legal losses?  /u/Megalodon481 r/DuggarsSnark [link] [comments]', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/18a52a8/does_pest_take_anything_seriously/', -0.30000001192092896)\n",

I started playing tennis seriously in September 2023, I will have had about thirty lessons with a Federer team 105 racket, paid 50 euros on Amazon, just to get started. Now I can hit the ball fairly well, but I feel this racket is a little weak, especially in the forehand. You have to give a lot of strength to give fairly normal blows, even with all the strength I have. The ball often goes to the net, as if the racket always required a lot of force to push. I really struggle with my shots, although among the beginners I play with I don't do too badly. The strings feel weak, even though the racket is new. I kindly ask you for advice on a new racket, even a slightly superior one, that can help me, even if slightly, in my performance. If possible, even a racket that you can keep for the foreseeable future, without having to replace it in a year. I play a lot with cut balls and forehands, little with my backhand.

That is to say I want a 50 dollar per hour skill level.  The thing is, how would I know this? I play live and the hours it takes to reach “the long run” and the fact that in this time the game changes and so will my skill so that it seems impossible to use actual money earned as a metric.  How could I ever know I hit, or am approaching my goal? How can I measure success and progress?  Is there a way to actually measure skill? Like a computer program or something? Or else maybe I could get a coach who has coached enough people and ask his honest opinion? I intend to play online for practice, is there some equivalent bb/100 at a certain stake that equates roughly to let’s say 2/5?  I know there isn’t a way to know with certainty how much I can earn. I understand that. But, for me at least, I find some sort of metric to be almost necessary. I like to see a graph line slanting up!  Anyone have any ideas.  For reference I used to pretty much slay live poker about 10 years ago. But, I want good, they were so bad. I was just a nit. lol.  I’ve read all the old classic books, Theory of poker etc that were out back then. Like a the dozen most recommended. So, I’m not a complete beginner.

What to do?', 'I am writing this post from the perspective of my mother (50sF) as this situation involves her and not myself, but she doesn\\'t use Reddit. I don\\'t know if I should ask in this subreddit but I don\\'t know where else. I\\'ve tried r/schizophrenia as well but waiting on moderator approval. I live a few hours away from home (in college), so I am recounting all of this based on what my mom told me through text messages. I was not there to witness any of it. My mom is friends/acquaintances with a woman (50sF) who has schizophrenia. Let\\'s call the friend Ruth. We don\\'t know the details of her diagnosis but we know that she is on medications and sees a psychiatrist. According to what my mom has told me, Ruth is very obviously \"unwell\" but for the most part she has been able to maintain a relatively normal friendship with my mom. My mom visits Ruth from time to time and takes her out to lunch or coffee, etc. Two days ago (Friday morning), my mom went to visit her and took her out to lunch and then they went back to our house for coffee. According to my mom, Ruth began having \"a nervous breakdown\" while at our house and began crying and talking about how someone is going to kill her, she doesn\\'t want to die, etc. She stayed at our house for hours while crying and my mom was trying to comfort her. My mom tried to drive Ruth back to her own house at one point during that night, but Ruth\\'s husband apparently did not want to even look at her, barely spoke to her, and did not want her back in the house. My mom then drove her back to our house, where she spent the night. My mom was on the phone with Ruth\\'s doctor at one point and he told her what medications Ruth can take and recommended her to take something to help her fall asleep. Ruth ended up not sleeping at all last night, and neither did my mom as she had to stay up the entire night taking care of her. The next day (Saturday/yesterday), my mom spent the entirety of the day comforting Ruth and driving her around the city and to various places to calm her down. She took her to a dog cafe, etc. Ruth kept asking to go to my mom\\'s aunt\\'s house, she kept insisting that she needs to go to other people\\'s houses, etc. Last night my mom drove Ruth back to her own house. Ruth\\'s husband was drinking and yelling at Ruth the whole time. Ruth was pleading my mom not to leave her there alone because of abuse, but she also refused to go back to my mom\\'s house with her because \"someone was going to catch her and kill her there.\" So my mom ended up spending the night at Ruth\\'s and her husband\\'s house. Now it\\'s 5PM the next day (Sunday), and Ruth is back at our house with my mom. She is not eating at all. At this point it has been about 54 hours of my mom not leaving Ruth\\'s side. My younger brother (15) has been staying out of it, but my dad has been helping my mom with Ruth in any way that he can. My mom has called multiple mental health hotlines and they have all told her that she needs to take Ruth to the ER. I have been telling my mom this entire time that she needs to take Ruth to the ER or call emergency services, but she keeps saying that Ruth is refusing to go, and that she can\\'t take her by force. My mom has always been the type of person to be extremely generous and over-exert herself for the sake of others, but at this point I believe that she is just doing a disservice to Ruth as well. My mom keeps saying that she can\\'t take her to the ER by force but I suggested that she lie to Ruth about where they are driving and then drive her to the ER, but I don\\'t know if that would just put her in danger/cause more trauma. My mom doesn\\'t know what to do. Any advice at all would be appreciated. We are in the United States but Ruth is an immigrant and aside from her husband, I don\\'t think she has any other family here.  /u/Klutzy-Sweet-6409 r/Advice [link] [comments]', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/18a52gu/friend_with_schizophrenia_has_been_in_an_episode/', -0.20000000298023224)\n",

The Kidde begins recording peak CO levels above 10ppm detected - and I am consistently getting an average of 11-15ppm peak readings anywhere I put the detector (in the room with gas appliances, near an open window with fresh air, and outdoors on the deck plugged in). It was making me think this was a faulty device because it would seem unlikely the open/fresh air is reading at 10+ppm (?!).  We just started using a Defender low level CO detector, which begins real time readings at 5ppm and above. So far it has continued reading 0 while next to the Kidde which, immediately after resetting the peak memory, will still jump back to reading 11-15ppm in minutes. Does anyone have any thoughts about this?? Does anyone know if the Kidde sensors tend to read higher than the actual CO concentration? I e-mailed Kidde and they insisted this was accurate within 2-3ppm (so, even if that is true, the Defender should be picking something up). I don't want to have levels above 5ppm but especially not 10+ in our home with a small child, so I am being especially cautious.  /u/Embarrassed-Sand2956 r/hvacadvice [link] [comments]\", 'https://www.reddit.com/r/hvacadvice/comments/18a52fk/thoughts_on_defender_low_level_co_detector/', -0.20000000298023224)\n",

I took a 2nd Class Fireman course over the summer and my exam is on December 27th. As to why I chose this course, don’t ask it’s a long story. But I got a raw deal with the course. It was all over Zoom and 0% hands-on. I took it because my employer was offering to pay for it before I got laid-off this past October and it was the soonest course available. The instructor for the course basically just read the text book each class and I didn’t really learn anything beyond what I could read by myself. There were some other major problems with the course.  The class was mixed with 1st Class Fireman and 3rd Engineers and the instructor, Paul would often ramble and when I would ask him a question would often go, 'don’t worry you don’t need to know this for the exam.’ So I was at times trying to learn useless information.  He gave us a ‘Dictation Sheet’ which is steps to memorize for the oral exam. Basically a script for describing, i.e. Blowdown Procedure, How to change a Gage Glass, etc. and it’s 19 pages of different stuff to memorize. I was taking a good look at it recently and realized it was FILLED with typos everywhere. A few of the steps had ‘Drop valve’ and ‘Drip valve’ so I called Paul and asked what those were and he responded, ‘Oh sorry those are labeled wrong, it’s supposed to be Drain valve and Stop Valve. I didn’t write that sheet someone gave it to me.’ So he gave all of us WRONG INFORMATION.  It’s so unclear what I need to know for the exam. I have plenty of worksheets to know for the multiple-choice, but as for the oral exam it’s crazy unclear what I need to know and I can’t get a straight answer out of him or anyone.

This last week 2 major issues have occurred, first a deep but small gauge in the brand new hybrid flooring in front of the oven (which the floor installer says cannot be fixed without ripping up the floor to replace the panel). Second issue they templated the stone bench tops as a paid service and went 20mm shorter on the width than the planned design, making the breakfast bar overhang shorter than we planned. Obviously only discovered this after the stone bench tops were installed…!  Other slapstick issues we’ve had like breaking melamine when cutting holes and drawers rubbing we haven’t even raised yet.  What’s a suitable compensation to settle on these fuck ups, if we simply want the build to be finished now so we can stop camp cooking outside?

I feel very lucky that I never developed physical dependency even after a decade of hard use. But psychological addiction is every bit as real.  For me, the allure of alcohol is that it guarantees happiness without any effort. It's unearned contentment. Peace for free. Or, rather, it lets me borrow good vibes from the future, no money down.  Here I am, stone sober and utterly miserable, and I can't help but pine for the one thing in my life that's always been there for me... even though it's truly more like a payday loan mixed with an abusive spouse. Like all participants of toxic relationships, I remember the good parts until I'm in the middle of the shit. So I sit here thinking about the vapid happiness of getting drunk and zoning out while I ignore the gut pain and the crippling hangovers and the social isolation and the memory destruction and the shitty work ethic and the shame and the guilt and the constant lying.  I don't want a beer. I just want to be happy. But just like digging out from under a mountain of debt, it takes time and effort to pay back all that borrowed happiness. And that payday loan is always waiting in the back of the gas station or the corner of the grocer, promising instant happiness right now without effort. Who cares about the interest on the loan? Who cares about how much happiness I'll lose tomorrow and the next day and the next?  Well... I care. I'm tired of being trapped in this scam. So I'm saving up and paying off that debt, and it's not fun and it's not easy. But one of these days, I'm going to have enough in the bank to buy some happiness, and I'm going to have earned that shit.  /u/cedarvan r/stopdrinking [link] [comments]\", 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/18a52uz/being_sober_is_easy_its_being_happy_thats_hard/', 0.0)\n",

So I am attempting a [method I found on YouTube]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ruSYfXTG9Q ), but her presentation is... a little lacking. And since it\\'s for children, I can\\'t comment to ask her questions.  She\\'s using 8 tbsp of a homemade 11% polyvinyl alcohol solution with 1/2 tbsp of scented oil, which are then agitated with a milk frother for 30 minutes (this seemed overkill to me as mine were definitely fully mixed in under 10 minutes - **but am I mistaken?**). Then she introduces a \"small amount\" of \"Water Gel,\" which I now know is sodium polyacrylate. The solution becomes thick and grainy in appearance. She then screen prints the mixed solution onto her sticker paper and lets it dry. In her video, it seems to have applied a consistent amount of concentrated bumpiness across the paper.  I have some questions about this process. Firstly, I bought a premade 4% PVA solution because I don\\'t have a slow cooker to make my own. **What effect will this have on the outcome? Should I buckle down and try to make my own solution, or is the 11% overkill?**  Also, when buying supplies I just searched \"water gel\" and ended up with potassium polyacrylate instead of sodium polyacrylate. I was unable to find out whether this would cause issues. It seems they can both be used for microencapsulation, but I\\'m not sure how that applies to this project specifically. **Will I need specifically sodium polyacrylate?**  My results are not great so far. Here are my notes on my experiment:  - 8 tsbp 4% pva solution  - 1 tsp scented oil  - 3/4 tsp potassium polyacrylate  First batch using above ingredients didn\\'t go well on glossy laminate. It separated into droplets. Suspect combo of laminate and not enough polyacrylate. Added another 1/4 tsp to the remaining solution, which provided a much closer appearance to the video. It also sat about 10-15 minutes which might have helped.  Second attempt was on vinyl without laminate. There was still some separation/beading, but it overall looked a bit better. Unsure if it\\'s due to thicker solution or lack of laminate.  Matte laminate looks promising but I do think it\\'s going to end up beading as well.  After 2 hours, the matte has definitely also beaded, although to a lesser extent (because the solution was allowed to sit longer? Did I unconsciously screenprint it at a different speed?). Also scratching definitely just removes the dried solution from the laminate. Unsure if this is an issue with the laminate, or if it\\'s the pva not being a strong enough solution.  Current thoughts are:  - Maybe 4% pva isn\\'t strong enough  - maybe it\\'s that i need sodium polyacrylate instead of potassium  - maybe my screen printing screen is too fine  - maybe I need to be doing this on paper instead of printable vinyl  If you\\'ve read this far, thank you! I would really appreciate some explanations, and feel free to assume I know nothing that isn\\'t spelled out in this post. I am not very strong in hard sciences, so extra hand-holding will be welcome.

La intoxicación alimentaria provocó una reacción extremadamente negativa el domingo de la semana pasada, pero gracias a Dios que los efectos iniciales no duraron mucho tiempo. Sin embargo, desde entonces he experimentado un dolor leve en la región del abdomen donde tenía fuertes contracciones musculares mientras sufría de diarrea.  Volví a hacer ejercicio el martes, pero solo hice mi rutina de calistenia para evitar la náusea que sentía después de la infección inicial. Mi cuerpo logró expulsar toda la bacteria que causaba la irritación intestinal y las fuertes contracciones musculares en el estómago, pero parecía que no era todo que estaba por llegar. Cuando retomé las sessiones de correr el miércoles, sentí un mareo inexplicable al iniciar la sesión y tuve que terminarla de forma abrupta a consecuencia de la sensación de querer vomitar. Después de que las náuseas remitieran, intenté correr otra vez y, afortunadamente, logré correr sin mayores problemas.  Ahora los únicos efectos colaterales que permanecen son los de los dolores en los costados del cuerpo. Desde anteayer, he logrado correr sin tener ganas de vomitar, pero el reinicio de todas mis rutinas de ejercicio ha sido un poco lento de lo esperado. Yo pensaba que iba a poder hacerlo todo después de casi 4 días de recuperación sin hacer ningún tipo de ejercicio. Es verdad que volví a trabajar el lunes, no obstante, mi trabajo no es difícil lo suficiente para provocar o causar estrés adicional a mi cuerpo. De todos modos, espero no tener ningún problema a partir de mañana porque vuelvo a hacer ejericicio a tope.  /u/Solanium r/WriteStreakES [link] [comments]', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/WriteStreakES/comments/18a532s/streak_900_la_recuperación_lenta/', 0.20000000298023224)\n",

I was technically assigned in the low incidences classes with the work based learning group and now I’m one on one with a kid in the general ed classes. I have experience in both settings.  My kid’s previous para asked to be moved back to low incidence so I took over because as I’ve said, I have experience in both settings.  (At the school I’m at, the sped teachers especially the head teachers take into account our feelings about wanting to move to a class different setting hence the switching of paras were very smooth)  (Quick background before moving on to teaching I was a Parapro at a middle school and the kids I’m working with now were those two kids.)  And now I love working with my one on one kid, but now I’ve found out why the other para wanted to be switched. They unofficially added another kid for me to support even though officially it doesn’t say the kid needs a para on their IEP. The kid and my kid share all four academic classes so technically there’s a para in the room for the kid because the parent wants their kid to have a para and the parent refuses to set a meeting to make it official. So basically the kid is part of my one on one even though I’m fully my kid’s one on one on a technicality. So I’m working full time with my one on one kid ( I was told that my kid was going to be the only kid I’m working with) and the other student. I graduated with a SPED degree, so I know how sped classes and laws work and I’m pretty sure the extra workload I’m getting is not legal?  (I’m not teaching sped despite the degree because I had a kinda traumatic experience last year as a teacher and then quit my teaching career but I still wanted to work with sped students)  At the middle school I was one on one with the same kid I’m doing one on one now and the kid was kinda added to mine but not really. I just did what I was told to do when the other student. The other student back in middle school had the para needed officially on his papers so I was fine with that back then. Now that student doesn’t have it in his papers that he needs a para and I’m not okay with that because I’m being forced to also work with him when I have my hands full with my one on one kid for all her needs.  It also doesn’t help that some of the teachers who clearly don’t have experience working with sped students in gen ed classes are putting all the work on me to get them to know their stuff for class. I’m not being paid a teacher’s salary to teach the sped students.  So now I feel guilty of asking to be moved back to the low incidence class because at least then they won’t use the fact that I’m visibly younger than the other paras so they know I’m up to date with class subjects.  /u/fe_kween r/paraprofessional [link] [comments]', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/paraprofessional/comments/18a531j/i_feel_guilty_wanting_to_move_back_to_low/', -0.20000000298023224)\n",

It genuinly hurts not being able to have fun and hangout with her cuz i habe a fuckton of school work.  I spent nights debating whether i should just cut contact and return to my normal life where i only hang out with my irl friends to save me all the pain. And at this point i dont know what to do.  /u/Average_artemis_ssig r/AdviceForTeens [link] [comments]', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/18a536b/i_have_to_either_get_rid_of_feelings_or_cut/', 0.0)\n",

Not meant to be an inflammatory question, more just a curiosity of mine as I often see watches which look similar to other watches but are considered “homages” to them rather than being considered copies of the design.  I just wondered what criteria differentiates the line between the two. Obviously I understand if the design is completely identical but with worse movement/build quality, but for other cases where the design is “inspired” by another watch. There’s probably a philosophical question of the difference between a design style vs an older watch which typically is associated with that style, but nevertheless wanted to see what you all thought.

Minsan naalala ko na lang na ako pa mismo bumili ng first good phone ko. Madalas kasing phone na binibigay sakin ay yung napagsawaan na or may may sira na, basta yung extra phone ba.  I mean, it's fine. I could take care of myself. Malaki naman na rin ako para humiling sa magulang ko. I'm working na. I have my own income.  But what pains me most is when they need something ako unang naalala. Ako unang nilalapitan. Ako unang hinihingian ng pera.  Kahit bata pa ko. Yung mga pabaon sakin na tinitipid ko, madalas mahingi den sakin. Yung mga pera na naiipon ko nung studyante pa ko galing sa pagbebenta ko ng cosplay stuff sa mga anime coventions, ayun napunta lahat sa bills sa bahay. Ni walang umabot nung nagwowork na ko.  Am I being ungratedul ba? I mean ako rin naman nakinabang sa bills na yun diba?  Pero kasi sobrang unfair. Hindi lang naman ako yung nagwowork sa bahay. Hindi lang naman ako yung gumagamit ng appliances.  Bakit kapag responsibilidad ang usapan ako unang nilalapitan?  Bakit kapag may mga utos sa bahay ako ang unang naalala?  I can't help it kung madalas masungit ako sa family ko.  I can't help it kung madalas passive agressive ang mga kilos ko.  Ngayon nagiipon ako kasi gustong gusto ko nang bumukod magisa. Per gusto ng magulang ko isama ko kuya ko sa pagbubukod ko dahil yung balak kong kunin na titirhan ay malapit sa workplace namin.  Okay lang sana kung hindi siya yung isa sa mga taong ginagawa akong katulong sa bahay ee.  May pangarap den naman ako. Gusto ko ring buo ng pamilya. Gusto kong magkaruon ng sariling tirahan na safe ako at alam kong pwede akong maging komportable.  Hirap na hirap akong humiwalay sa pamilyang to kasi ayaw nila kong mawala ng dahil sa alam nilang kailangan nila ako.  /u/meideechan r/OffMyChestPH [link] [comments]\", 'https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18a5387/the_middle_child/', 0.0)\n",

A couple days ago, I took it for a run around in the morning, then I went to start it about 6 hours later, it was endlessly cranking.  I checked the glow plugs, 2 of them were ok and two were reading about 3k ohms. I removed them all and fitted a new set, however the problem still occurs. I purchased a glow plug light and fitted that in line and all glow plugs are operating.  the battery was low at 11.5v, so tried jumping it off but still no good. I left it trickle charging overnight but still endlessly cranking.  The combo is fitted with an after market ignition barrel and the original key is taped to the immobiliser under the steering wheel column.

And I’m not saying it’s of utmost importance that they have to do something with Geo right here and now, since it’s probably a headache to redo and code stuff for it.  What I don’t really hear much about from popular opinions is just leaving Geo on its own, though. A lot of folks want Geo to react to more elements, but considering the characters they’ve released— doubt they have anything planned soon beyond what we’ve been sitting with since the beginning.  If they truly want Geo to be its own standalone type of element— I really wish they would expand on the types of things Geo can do. There’s magnetism for maybe minor CC, some sort of DoT mechanic potentially by imbedding Geo onto enemies (kinda like burning), or even blinding to make enemy attacks inaccurate/slow down.  There’s honestly probably more cool stuff you can do with stuff related to rocks, but… they just, don’t. Not to mention issues with Geo structures, which is already a double-edged sword in itself.  Like I get they want Geo to be doing its own thing, but honest to god it would be such a QoL improvement to not have to work with the same thing over and over again (with exception to buffers/supports, I guess). Again, I’m not criticizing the devs for it; there’s probably time constraints or particular limits they have to work around— but Geo does have potential, especially if they want to keep it generally by itself.

There have been ups and downs for sure, but I\\'m damn near at the end of my rope. The ownership who purchased said restaurant did so with dollar signs in their eyes, assuming that the restaurant business is soooo lucrative and exciting. Now they\\'re realizing their mistakes. Since they\\'ve brought me on to run the kitchen we\\'ve lost the AKM, two full time line cooks, 3 part time cooks, 2 dishwashers, and a pastry chef. Many of them were dead weight and happy to get rid of them, but I\\'ve only been allowed to hire 1 full time cook, and one part timer since losing so many. I am under a complete hiring and wage freeze, meaning I can\\'t promote anyone to the AKM position, nor can I give anyone raises, whether they\\'re due or not. And many of them were due before I took over.  On top of all this, I\\'ve been doing wine dinners and special events for the restaurant. They\\'ve been cool, and I\\'m happy to display my menus, but come the fuck on. I\\'m currently functioning as the chef, the assistant/sous, the pastry chef, a line cook, and an office worker, while also planning special wine dinners, brand new special holiday menus they\\'ve never done before, and expanding supposed catering offerings. All without being allowed to purchase anything new. I\\'ve done 4 wine dinners and I\\'m not allowed to purchase ANY new plateware for any of it. The last dinner I had to send out the entrees on 3 different style plates. It\\'s fucking embarrassing, especially after putting my heart and soul into the menu.  They\\'re demanding I do our first ever buffet for NYE, but they won\\'t let me purchase plates. Our restaurant seats 80-90 people, and we have 100 of the plates that they would like to use for said buffet. They looked me dead in the fucking eyes and said that\\'s enough plates for an AYCE buffet, then they tried to quell my concerns by letting me know that we can also use side plates for the desserts. Ohhhhh. Problem solved.  So yeah, money has obviously been tight, but I\\'ve been given no budget to work with or no guidelines for any of it. I\\'m doing my absolute best, but this place had almost no structure when I took over and it\\'s quite an uphill battle getting everything going.  What is really setting me over the edge is our December 1 \"financial\" meeting where I was told we\\'re immediately transitioning to Wed-Sunday service as opposed to 7 days. When they took over last year it was only open 5 days, but they demanded that they open 7 days, the previous KM was forced to hire a bunch of new staff and get it all coordinated. Now I get the absolute pleasure of laying off at least 3 part timers and 1 full timer and completely reorganizing our whole operation. So with no support, no AKM, no one to talk through these issues with, I get to ruin multiple people\\'s holiday month by just tossing them aside. I feel like a piece of shit and I\\'m exhausted.

The Need for Secure Cross-Chain Transfers  In the evolving multichain landscape, the demand for secure and efficient cross-chain transfers is skyrocketing. Alephium's core contributors have invested significant efforts in crafting a battle-tested solution for their first bridge to/from Ethereum, and it's worth exploring how it works.  🚀 How Does the Alephium Bridge Work?  The Alephium Bridge is no ordinary bridge – it's a sophisticated lock & mint bridge, built on top of a fork of Wormhole. Why Wormhole? It's open source, boasts considerable Total Value Locked (TVL), and has demonstrated resilience through various incidents. Plus, it's well-documented, making it an ideal choice.  🔍 Main Components of the Alephium Bridge  This bridge isn't just a single piece; it's a system with three main components: guardians, contracts & messages.   Guardians: A network of guardians, consisting of four at launch, plays a crucial role in validating messages and executing the VAA multisig process.  Core Contracts: The heart of the system lies in Alephium and Ethereum contracts, monitored by guardians. These contracts are pivotal for cross-chain communication and are deployed on each chain.  Emitters Contracts: These contracts initiate and interact with the core contracts, facilitating the publication and reception of messages on both the origin and destination chains.  Transaction Logs: Blockchain-specific logs that guardians use to observe messages from the core contracts.   🌐 Interacting with the Alephium Bridge  Alephium's bridge isn't just a technological marvel; it's also an infrastructure and a governance mechanism. Here are various ways you can interact with it:   Smart Contracts: For the programmatically inclined, interact directly with Alephium and Ethereum smart contracts.  Run Your Front-End: Want a personalized experience? Run your own front-end or even fork the open-source bridge to create your guardian network.  Alephium's Interface: If simplicity is your game, Alephium provides its own user-friendly interface for easy bridge utilization.   Exciting times ahead for Alephium as they bridge the gap between chains! 🌉 What are your thoughts on their approach?  /u/Layibumper r/Alephium [link] [comments]\", 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Alephium/comments/18a53gt/the_bridge_of_alephium/', 0.30000001192092896)\n",

I\\'ve become someone who\\'s okay with just being by myself and staring at my screen even enjoying it a lot of times, watching YouTube videos, doing art, consuming media to fuel my creativity, looking for work, doing some physical activity, and talking to online friends.

And it really makes me feel anxious and messes with my head, I don\\'t know what to do about it, I\\'m also at a place where there\\'s not much to do outside, nor the money to travel or go to nice places, I feel stuck and like I\\'m doing something wrong or rather that my life is wrong...It\\'s just really depressing, I\\'d appreciate some thoughts on it or advice if anyone has something for me.  /u/undiagnoseddude r/adhd_anxiety [link] [comments]', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/18a53ka/feeling_lost_and_like_im_not_living_life/', -0.10000000149011612)\n",

I thought we had naturally progressed into that type of relationship. 2 months go by and she reminds me that we are only FWB\\'s and nothing else. I told Sarah I was sorry if I had overstepped any boundaries, although very distraught and saddened by the situation. I told them I needed time to think and process things, but before I could they texted ema and asked if we could be girlfriend and boyfriend and they said yes. initially I was extremely happy but later I realized this type of relationship prolly wasn\\'t for me. I felt that I wasn\\'t a true priority . I asked Sarah if we could be exclusive she said no as she didn\\'t want to hurt ema who had been super understanding about the entire thing.

For example: she accesses the hammspace in the wall beside a house and hides a bag of cash in there; now, to get that money back, she has to go back to that specific place to reach that are of the hammerspace. If the wall is broken, that money is gone, but is the wall is transposed intact, she can still reach that part of her pocket dimension. \\\\ If she is in the hammerspace and the surface she entered through is broken, she is ejected immediately. Some applications include: phasing inside walls to hide; phase weapons/bullets inside armor; hide inside a surface and have someone move that surface. She also has an awareness of what is hidden in her hammerspace, which can double as a tracking method. \\\\ Please tell me what you think, and thank you in advance!  /u/Weird-Pandaroo r/Parahumans [link] [comments]\", 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/18a53sd/power_idea/', 0.0)\n",

I just completed my first rotation, on a Hematology/Oncology floor and will be doing Peds and L&D next semester. A professor in my program posted a job opportunity for a Girl\\'s Scout \"Health Supervisor\" position that I applied to and got an interview for. I am wondering if anyone has any experience with camp nursing, can give me a rundown of a day-to-day, and if anyone has experience at a Girl Scout camp specifically, that would be amazing.  I am a little intimidated by the fact that the position is \"Health Supervisor\", judging by the job application I would be the person who is in charge of all things medical for the entire camp for 9 weeks. They are specifically looking for a nursing student though, so I don\\'t necessarily feel under qualified, just intimidated.  The pay is actually really good, it\\'s free food and lodging, and it seems fantastic for my resume since I would be in a leadership position and also practicing my nursing skills. If I get the job I think I will definitely take it, but I want to be as prepared as possible. I am even considering taking an EMT-B course just to feel extra solidified on emergency first-aid situations in preparation for the job. Also if I get it, it\\'ll be nice to be coming straight from my Peds rotation, as the age range of the camp is 5-17 years old.

As far as I am aware, the ILS have no means of delivering to other specific ILS. If you want one to be left alone, then you toggle the range, but if you have a network of stars you want linked up, say, for science production, you probably want your other factory slices to be far away. But what if the \"perfect planet\" is within the line-crossing distance between the two groups? Then some random ship from your science zone could go and fly off towards that instead, potentially screwing up throughput if the distance is great enough.  Though this isn\\'t a huge deal in the long run, since you can always make do (as I have thus far) by tweaking certain things and limiting the distance of the ILS, but I, as well as potentially other people, would find it useful to fine-tune things by just clicking buttons. A simple separate tab in the ILS GUI could switch the ILS from distance-based deliveries to a point-to-point system where you could select other specific stations, removing the need to fiddle with the transport range of ships, instead making a single straight connection between two (or more) stations. Since we can already rename ILS, that is a start, but the ability to give them icons like blueprints could also aid in setting them up. Perhaps the same could apply to the PLS as well, but I can\\'t think of a use off the top of my head, maybe someone else can think of one.  With all that being said, this is not my game, the devs can do what they want. I am merely suggesting something that I would find useful in certain cases.  /u/KrAsTaLaR r/Dyson_Sphere_Program [link] [comments]', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Dyson_Sphere_Program/comments/18a545i/dedicated_pointtopoint_ils_capability_a_niche_but/', -0.10000000149011612)\n",

It doesnt make logical sense to me to stop investigating if you find an abnormal blood result, especially as it was never relayed to me the first time, or investigated.  I submitted a SAR to access my old medical records. I was having chest pains which went on for 6 weeks and I ignored it (assuming maybe viral) until I couldn’t any more. I described it as feeling like an elephant sitting on my chest - a crushing pain. My chest also hurt - acute stabbing pain - at the bottom of an exhalation. The GP did the usual basic tests, took some bloods, then gave me a sealed letter and told me to go straight to hospital, but didn’t say why. I had various tests and was sent away with “you’re too young and healthy to be having a heart attack”. I wouldn’t have waited weeks to call a GP if I suspected I was having one, but I understand at a hospital they are looking to rule out life or death scenarios.  My records say:  Triage category 2 Temp: 36°C HR: 113bpm BP: 159/106 MAP: 123.67 SPO2: 99%  ECG: sinus rhythm with premature supraventrivular complexes  Bloods: Chloride - abnormal (high) ESR - abnormal (high) Prothrombin time - abnormal (high) Eosinophils - abnormal (low) Vitamin D - insufficient  At the time: age 27, normal BMI, athletic (weightlifting), healthy diet.

I rinsed the roots completely off so they looked clean then I let them dry no soil for the afternoon, no light and under a fan. Once roots were dry I potted them and watered them and the soil. It's been roughly a week since I did this and they are starting to shrivel up. Did I kill them? Are they slowly dying? Or are they just trying to heal? Or do u think it may be completely un-related? Any help or suggestions would be appreciated. Iv wasted so much time and money trying to get these guys going. Finally got 2 going well then I messed it up. Please tell me I can fix this... U can see the lights in the pics the lights r on roughly a 14 hr on 8 hour off cycle. 24 hours a day it's a got a big fan blowing directly on them, house temp stays between 70-80, soil temp usually reads about 69-74. Normally water once per week. PH level is low, roughly 3-5 in all pots. Humidity is non issue. Any advice would help.  submitted by /u/Visually_Visual to r/sanpedrocactus   [link]  [comments] \", 'https://www.reddit.com/r/sanpedrocactus/comments/18a54gj/shriveling_after_root_wash_tbm_short_form_please/', -0.20000000298023224)\n",

Everytime I tell him I want to go see my cousin he keeps arguing stating he isnt my cousin and all I want to do is go have sex with him. Gross!!!  I knew he was going to his daughters house today, then when I called my daughter to see if she was still with him she said he is at his EX house. This EX has a child that is grown now so IDK why he had to go see her. I made a good point to him and he didn\\'t like it. \"So, you are playing double standards. You are at your EX house but when I want to go visit my cousin I can\\'t because it starts an argument. How is that even right? Or even fair\"? I don\\'t care where he goes I also mentioned how I have to trust him but he can\\'t trust me at all. 🤔 He said, \"because I know my EX doesn\\'t want me\". I yelled in the phone, \"that isn\\'t the damn point. The point is, you can see an EX which isn\\'t a family member but I can\\'t see a cousin which is a family member\"?!?!? At the point I am irritated with him. He then says, \"you can go see him if you want but don\\'t do anything I wouldn\\'t do\". At this point I end the call.

When i'm not there i drain the pipes and keep the heat at around 7 degrees C, it works pretty well but there is one pipe that runs along an exterior wall that often freezes up, the only place it does that in the whole house, i guess with the small amount of liquid that's left in the pipes after draining them and turning the water off. 2 years ago that pipe burst and caused a pretty big flood, wrecking the ceiling in the process. A plumber told me to throw some insulation up there but it doesn't really do any good since most of the time the house is around 7 degrees (or less). So i've purchased a heat cable ( Maxkoso Self regulating heat cable) to run along the pipe but i'm wondering about the safety of doing this, could this thing cause a fire? Due to the flooding we never bothered to fix the ceiling we instead put some foam core tiles up there just incase it happened again. So i would need to run this cable along the pipe, cut a small hole in the foam core, run it down the wall (i was thinking of hiding it in a cable trough) and then plugging it in. ON the box it says don't run it through walls or ceilings, but how are you supposed to plug it in otherwise? Will the cable damage the wall or the cable trough? Just not sure about these kind of cables, how hot they actually get and if this is safe, i'm a total layman and not handy at all so please explain like i'm an idiot, because i am.

With that being said, I dabbled back into sports betting again. Ups and downs as we all know, but managed to be up for a few months going into this week. As I knew in the back of my head that it would eventually happen if I kept at it, I lost that money and then a good chunk of my own. It is way more than I ever would wish to spend in a week, and really makes me feel so ashamed more than anything. The night I lost a bunch of money, I think I slept for about one hour total, tossing and turning. The emotional and mental toll this crap takes on you is crazy. I have been a shell of myself for a few days and try to rationalize with myself how I could spend a few grand on NOTHING. I self excluded from DK for 5 years in my state and have banned myself from the other books available to me in the state I work in. I now have a family and it’s not just about me anymore. Thankfully I put a stop to it after a couple days trying to chase and make money back. I still have money in the bank and my family, I need to focus on the great things I have. I wish I was one of those people who could lose a little bit and walk away, but I had the impossible task of trying to be “up” everyday I was betting. I wish you all happy holidays and be well.

So what would you think if they gave up on new jobs for an expansion and instead chose 3 jobs to have new specs? Some examples would be GNB to melee dps, DRG to tank, and SGE to caster dps. They have the programming for transforming buttons and bozja gave us a small taste of roll swapping. While they would still have to create converted abilities for these specs they could reuse a lot of the animations to save time and wouldn't need to support a new weapon model going forward. This could also motivate people to play tanks and healers more if it means they are also getting a dps job out of the deal. These conversions don't need to be as extreme as SCH/SMN, Tanks already have 80% of a dps kit while anything converting to a tank just needs the basic tanking cooldowns.
