    "### Project Description\n",
    "Our project scope is to identify and understand the effects of lifestyle factors, medical history, and specific biomarkers on the risk of osteoporosis-related bone fractures. The objective is to build a predictive model that can anticipate the likelihood of fractures based on identified risk factors. The project will involve the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Analysis and Exploration:**\n",
    "   - Descriptive Analytics: Examine general trends, patterns, and correlations in the data to gain insights into the relationships between risk factors and fractures.\n",
    "   - Diagnostic Analytics: Delve deeper into identified patterns to understand the underlying reasons behind these patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Predictive Modeling:**\n",
    "   - Utilize machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model that accurately predicts fracture risk based on health and lifestyle factors.\n",
    "   - Employ a black box ensemble method to identify important features and refine the model's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prescriptive Analytics:**\n",
    "   - Provide prescriptive insights based on the predictive model to guide preventive measures, treatment plans, and policy decisions.\n",
    "   - Recommend lifestyle changes and interventions for high-risk groups identified by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will provide valuable insights into fracture risk assessment and enable informed decision-making regarding preventive measures, treatments, and policies related to osteoporosis-related fractures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Domain Question\n",
    "When combined with BMD data, what specific health-related issues or lifestyle factors are associated with increased fracture risk?\n",

    "#### Modeling\n",
    "Our team decided to divide and conquer with modeling.  Each team member built their own model and then measured the outcomes.  We discovered that the performance of the models drop after being tested on the validation set. Further work could be done on optimizations. Despite the current model not meeting our initial expectations, health screening applications are viable.\n",

    "### Summary Table of Model Scores\n",
    "Below is the summary table of the model results.\n",
    "Because the models were developed with the purpose of becoming a screening tool, the goal was to set a Recall value of 0.80. This would act as an acceptable amount of False negatives. From there the best model is one that also balanced precision well to minimize false positives. This left XGBoost Model 1 as the best performing model on the Test set."
