This is a collection of the Case Study work I did as part of my DSA Masters program with a group of three other students. It was done during the summer semester, so I am proud of everything our team was able to accomplish in eight weeks
My work was primarily on the data pipelines, Bone Mineral Density Analysis, Light GBM, and a few of the other lifestyle related forms (FF - Fracture history, and GI-General Information). However, it was a group project and there was a lot of collaborative learning.
The work is broken into Sprint Increments (SpIns), so a lot of work is iterated across the SpIns. Final work is in the Final Artifacts.
